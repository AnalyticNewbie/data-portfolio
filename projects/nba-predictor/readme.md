# NBA Game Prediction System (Win% + Score + 95% Intervals)

An end-to-end NBA forecasting system that ingests NBA data daily (ET-correct), engineers team/game features in Postgres, trains baseline models, and produces:
- **Home win probability**
- **Predicted home/away scores**
- **Simulation-based 95% prediction intervals**

This project is designed as a **production-style ML system** (data pipeline + feature store + training + prediction + uncertainty), not a one-off notebook.

## Key outputs

For each scheduled game (ET date), the predictor produces:

- `home_win_prob_pct`
- `pred_home`, `pred_away` (mean prediction)
- `home_95pi`, `away_95pi` (simulation-based prediction interval)

Intervals are generated by simulating margin and total outcomes:
- `margin ~ Normal(μ_margin, σ_margin)`
- `total  ~ Normal(μ_total,  σ_total)`
and converting to scores:
- `home = (total + margin) / 2`
- `away = (total - margin) / 2`

## Architecture

NBA API → Python ingestion (ET-correct) → Postgres (Docker) → SQL feature engineering → training views → Python models → predictions

**Time zone design:** ET is the canonical timeline; user input dates can be AEDT but are converted to ET for querying.

## Tech stack

- **Python**: 3.13 (venv)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (Docker Desktop)
- **Key libs**: nba_api, psycopg2, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib
- **SQL tooling**: psql / DBeaver
